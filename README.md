COULOMB (PYTHON) Project

The package is designed for quantum chemistry calculations
of electrostatic interaction energy between two molecular species.
Currently, the implemented methods are:

1) Electrostatic energy from distributed charges,
2) Electrostatic energy from distributed multipoles,
3) Electrostatic energy from density cube files,
4) Electrostatic energy from exact first-order expression 
   for two interacting charge densities. 
   
The auxiliary methods implemented are:

1) ESP - charges from fitting to the electrostatic potential,
2) CAMM - Cumulative Atomic Multipole Moments.

The tutorial is under preparation.
