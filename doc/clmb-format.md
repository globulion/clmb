Coulomb file format
===================

This file format indicates the DMTP (Mulliken, ChelpG, DMA, CAMM etc.)
distributions. The format is free. It have three major fields:
  * distributed moments
  * atomic symbols and coordinates
  * origins of distributed moments (optional)

If the latter field is absent, it means that origins=structure.
